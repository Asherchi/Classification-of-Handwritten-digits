# Classification-of-Handwritten-digits
 The MNIST dataset, contained in mnist-original.mat (matlab format), consists of 70,000 digitized handwritten digits and their labels. I classified them using 2 different classifiers,  a stochastic gradient descent classifier called SGDClassifier (we will talk about this in class) and a logistic regression classifier called LogisticRegression.
